This project definition provides a starting point for developing an AI Business Analyst application.  The specific functionalities and features will be further refined based on detailed user research and technical considerations.

# Structured Process To Develop and Deploy the Application

## Phase 1: Define Requirements and Goals

- Stakeholder Engagement: Involve key stakeholders from different departments (sales, marketing, supply chain, finance) to understand their data needs and - reporting goals. Discuss the types of questions they want answered and the insights they are looking for.
- Data Inventory: Identify all the relevant data sources within your company. This could include CRM systems, ERP systems, marketing automation platforms, - financial databases, and warehouse management systems.
- Data Analysis: Analyze the available data to understand its structure, quality, and any potential challenges in data integration.
- Define KPIs (Key Performance Indicators): Determine the key metrics and KPIs that will be used to measure success across different departments.


## Phase 2: Data Acquisition and Transformation

- Data Extraction: Use appropriate tools and techniques to extract data from various sources. This might involve using pgwalker for PostgreSQL databases, APIs for cloud-based platforms, or direct database connections.
- Data Transformation: Clean and transform the extracted data using tools like pandas. This could involve:
- Handling missing values: Filling missing data points with appropriate values or removing rows with excessive missing data.
- Data type conversions: Ensuring data types are consistent across columns for accurate analysis in Power BI.
- Data formatting: Standardizing date and time formats for consistency.
- Creating calculated fields: Deriving new data points based on existing data (e.g., calculating profit margin).
- Data Integration: Combine data from different sources into a single, unified data model. This may involve resolving data inconsistencies and creating relationships between tables.


## Phase 3: Building the Power BI Report

- Data Modeling: Create a data model in Power BI Desktop that defines the relationships between tables and ensures data consistency.
- Report Design: Start building visuals like charts, graphs, and tables to represent the KPIs and insights identified earlier.
- Focus on clarity and user experience: Ensure visuals are easy to understand and navigate.
- Utilize appropriate visualizations: Choose chart types that best represent the data (e.g., bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends).
- Interactive elements: Consider incorporating slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities for users to explore the data further.
- Formatting and Branding: Apply consistent formatting and branding elements (logos, colors) to give your report a professional look and feel.


## Phase 4: Deployment and Sharing

- Publishing the Report: Publish your finalized report to the Power BI service, making it accessible to authorized users within your company.
- User Training: Provide training to users on how to access, navigate, and interpret the Power BI reports effectively.
- Governance and Refreshing: Establish a governance plan to ensure data refresh schedules are defined and data quality is maintained. Regularly refresh data sources to keep reports up-to-date.


## Additional Considerations:

> Security: Implement appropriate security measures to restrict access to sensitive data within the Power BI reports.
> Scalability: Consider the scalability of your Power BI application as the volume and complexity of your data grows.
> Collaboration: Encourage collaboration by allowing users to share insights and feedback on the reports.
